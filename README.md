What has been added:
1. 2-factor authentication for registration and Login using PHPmailler which sends OTP to users' email.
2. Payment system using PayPal API.
3. Machine learning algorithm(Linear Regression) that determines the optimal pricing of the appointment.
4. Changes to the database structure.
5. Logic changes such as number of appointments a patient can book or cancel at a time to prevent
   repetitive booking and canceling of the same patient. Also a patient's appointment date should not
   clash with another appointment made by the same patient at the same time duration.
